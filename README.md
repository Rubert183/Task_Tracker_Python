**About:**

Hi! I’m Robert, and I created a simple yet efficient Task Tracker using Python. This tool helps you manage tasks by adding, updating, marking progress, deleting, and sorting them easily.

**Usage:**

To see all available commands, run the program and type "help".

**Task States:**

Each task can have one of the following states:

to do → Task is pending.
in progress → Task is currently being worked on.
done → Task is completed.

**Date Format:**

The tracker uses the YYYY/MM/DD format for dates.

Features

✅ Add, update, and delete tasks
✅ Mark tasks as to do, in progress, or done
✅ View tasks based on their status or date
✅ Sort tasks alphabetically or by last edited date
